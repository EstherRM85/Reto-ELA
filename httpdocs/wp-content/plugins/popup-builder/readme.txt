== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**How many popups can I create?**

You can have as many popups as you want on the same page, but you can only set one popup to be opened on page load, the others must be set to open on click.

**How can I set a popup to open automatically?**

After creating your popup, go to the desired page or post and you will see a meta box below the content editor, with the following title: "Select popup on page load". Select the popup you want to set and then update the page. You are done! After you go to that page/post the popup will get opened automatically.

**Want to insert a popup on a link, that will open up when clicked on the link?**

Simply add the following class to it: sg-confirm-popup-#popupid.

This will open a popup before a user goes to the page from the link.

**How to redirect users after clicking on the popup image?**

Go to the `Options` section of your popup and find "Dismiss on content click" option.
Then Select "Redirect" option and in the URL field type the URL of the page you need your users to be redirected to.
