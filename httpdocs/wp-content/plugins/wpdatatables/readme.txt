wpDataTables allows creating Line, Column and Pie charts using the Google Charts rendering engine, or simply show data in a table.

Creating tables and charts with a WordPress tables plugin has never been easier. It only takes 3 basic steps:

**Step 1 - Provide table data**

You can provide table data for WordPress tables by uploading Excel, CSV , JSON, XML or Serialized PHP array.

**Step 2 - Customization**

You can customize and configure the columns of your WordPress table (rename, reorder, add CSS classes, hide, change colors) in any way you see fit.

**Step 3 - Publish in a post or page**

Once you are happy with the design of your WordPress table, you can easily insert it on any post or page through Gutenberg, standard WP Editor and shortcode, or through page builders like WPBakery Page Builder, Visual Composer or Elementor. All tables will become sortable and will have pagination by default.

Additionally, each table can have a search bar and can have the following functions: “Copy to Clipboard”, “Export to CSV”, “Export to PDF”, “Export to XLS”. All these functionalities are configurable and it is your decision whether to toggle these on or off.

Following column data types are supported. Most column types, except the images, have their own sorting rules:

* String -  [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/string-columns/)
* Integer - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/integer-columns/)
* Float -   [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/float-columns/)
* Date -    [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/date-columns/)
* DateTime - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/datetime-columns/)
